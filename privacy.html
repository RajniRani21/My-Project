<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3>We protect your privacy.</h3>
<p>Our privacy policy is simple: any information you give us stays with us. We do not rent, sell, lend, or otherwise distribute your personal information to anyone for any reason. This includes your contact information, as well as specific order information.</p><br>

<h3>We limit data access to those who need to know.</h3>
<p>Within our organization, your personal data is accessible to only a limited number of employees with special access privileges. Although we may, from time to time, compile general demographic information based on your order, this information is shared within our organization only and has no identifiable personal data associated with it.</p><br>

<h3>Information Sharing</h3>
<p>Probably this is the most important question in your mind as to with whom do we share your information?

To some extent, information has to be passed on to the courier companies, credit card processing companies, vendors, etc. to enable them to perform their functions related to your order fulfilment. Apart from this normal business requirement, information may also be needed to be shared with law authorities, for fraud detection, and for the safety of our site, employees, management, users, members and other affiliates associated with us.</p><br>
